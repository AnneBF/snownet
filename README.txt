The sample code 'SNOWNET_sample_code.py' demonstartes how to use the AMSR2-only ('snownet.h5') 
and the AMSR2+SMOS ('snownet_smos.h5') neural networks for snow depth estimation.

To run the code you need a few packages installed including Tensorflow and Keras.
To make sure the model can be loaded and to reproduce the same results as presented 
in the paper, please install Tensorflow version 1.10.0 and Keras version 2.2.2.

When using the neural networks or the code, please cite:

Satellite Microwave Radiometry and a Neural Network, The Cryosphere (Discussions), (2019)'
